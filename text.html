<h2><i> My favorite</i> </h2>
<p> My favorite piece of clothing is a <blockquote>sock</blockquote>  despite the fact that I absolutely hate wearing them. There are so many cool designs for <blockquote><code>socks</code></blockquote> and I own a lot of them I just hate wearing <code>socks</code> unless I'm wearing shoes. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Skirts wih pockets
      <li><strong> Sweatpants </strong>
        <li> <em>Baggy</em> Shirts
          <li> Hoodies
    </ul>

      <li> Shirts with Poka Dots
        <li> Bedazzled hats
